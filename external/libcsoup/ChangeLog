	* csc_strcmp_param.c: fixed the bug and added a test case in main.

20151104: 0.8.9:
	* csc_config.c: csc_cfg_mkdir() updated the cfg->update flag once an
	internal directory was created, which is not necessary. It caused
	ezthumb save its setting everytime even nothing was changed. Let the
	caller of csc_cfg_mkdir() decide to set the cfg->update or not.

20151021: 0.8.8:
	* csc_strcmp_param.c: added

20151020: 0.8.7
	* csc_strbody.c: do not calculate the length if len is NULL.

20150513: 0.8.6
	* smm_config.c: truncated the existed configure by CSC_CFG_RWC method,
	otherwise the contents would be overlapped with the previous contents.

20150424: 0.8.5
	* csc_config.c: added csc_cfg_delete_key() and csc_cfg_delete_block().

20150311: 0.8.4
	* main/Makefile: fixed a bug that mkclicmd was forgotten to be cleaned.

20150305: 0.8.3

	missed a '\' between "SOFTWARE" and the path. Test case also changed.

20141012: 0.8.2
	* Makefile: added _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 macro otherwise the smm_fstat()
	would be failed when file size was over 2GB.

20140815: 0.8.1
	* Makefile: disable the slog-to-socket by macro SLOG_SOCKET
	because it's not used currently.

20140815: 0.8.0
	* slog: revised the slog module and redefined some functions.
	TODO: port the slog socket to winapi

20140717: 0.7.6:

	the attribution of the configure files/devices.

20140716: 0.7.3
	* csc_cdll.c: hide the details of the CSCLNK structure so the	
	CFG_CDLL_SAFE conditional compiling macro won't mess around other
	modules. The drawback is all CSCLNK type nodes must be allocated
	by csc_cdl_alloc().

20140715: 0.7.2
	* csc_config.c: added csc_cfg_kcb_free() instead of the smm_free() to
	free the root KEYCB. Otherwise coredumped at csc_cfg_open().

	csc_config interface. Win32 registry supported.

	* smm_config.c: rewrote to be the underlayer of csc_config.c.
	* csc_config.c: using smm_config.c as its I/O interface.

20140516: 0.6.4
	* smm_config.c: Renamed smm_config_read() to smm_config_read_alloc()
	to reflect its allocation nature. 
	Added smm_config_read_int() and smm_config_write_int().

	* csc_cfg_save(): save its subkey first then to walk through subkeys.

	Added csc_extname_filter_export() and
	csc_extname_filter_export_alloc();

20140513: 0.5.1
	* smm_config.c: updated smm_config_open() with a mode option.
