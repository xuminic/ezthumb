MathGL is a free library of fast C++ routines for the plotting of the data 
varied in one or more dimensions. MathGL has more than 50 general types 
of graphics for 1d, 2d and 3d data arrays. It can export graphics to bitmap 
and vector (EPS, SVG etc) files. It has OpenGL interface and can be used from 
console programs. It has functions for data handling and script MGL language 
for simplification of data plotting. Also it has several types of transparency 
and smoothed lightning, vector fonts and TeX-like symbol parsing, arbitrary 
curvilinear coordinate system and many over useful things. Finally it is 
platform independent and free (under GPL v.2.0 or later license).
Installation instructions are provided in the manual (don't worry, it
is straightforward).

About LGPL and GPL licenses.
Generally, MathGL is GPL library. However, you can use LGPL license for MathGL 
core and widget libraries if you don't use SWIG-based interfaces and disable GSL 
and HDF features. This can be done by using 'enable-lgpl' option at build time.
However, I ask you to put the information of used MathGL version and link to 
MathGL website into "About" section of yours program.
