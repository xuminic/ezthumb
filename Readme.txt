What is it
==========

Ezthumb is used to create thumbnails for video files. It uses the FFMPEG 
library as its engine so it almost supports any video formats. 
Normally the screenshots would be gridded into a single canvas picture or 
compose a single GIF animation file.  But it can also save frames separately.
The output format could be JPG, PNG, GIF or GIF animation, where PNG and GIF 
supports the transparent background. Batch processing allows.
