20111104:
  + Revisioned this project in MinGW and made it workable in MS Windows
  + Fixed the conditional compiling error for the FFMPEG version control

20111021: V1.5.4
  + merged the id_*.c into id_lookup.c
  + slightly adjusted the Makefile

20111021: V1.5.3
  + Release tag: RELEASE_1_5_3
  + Merge two branches into the new version for release

20111021: V1.5.2
  + Supported the maximum number when ripping the key frames
    Command line now support the '-p key@N' opion

20111007: V1.5.2
  + Added a rectify function in video_snapshot_skim() to speed up the
    doing in the unseekable media files.
  + Refined the video_find_stream() so it could also support 0.6.3 ffmpeg

20111006: V1.5.1
  + Fixed a bug of finding the video stream, now using av_find_best_stream().
  + Added the signal handler. Now ezthumb can be broken in the middle.

20111001: V1.5.0
  Make fixes and ready for release

20110908: V1.4.2
  Displaying the screen shot method has been moved into video_snap_begin()

20110908: V1.4.1
  heuristic method is ready for test.

20110906: V1.4.0
  Many codes regroups in recent day. Begin with a thought that reducing 
  scan passes if video file doesn't support backward seek. I roughly
  have got an idea of a heuristic method. Hope it can be done in 1.4.1

20110831:
  + ezthumb.c: a little bit speed up of the video_duration() function

20110830: V1.3.3
  + ezthumb.c: duration structure changed

20110829:
  + main.c: '--index' option and adjust the '-i', '-S' and '-I' options
  + ezthumb.c: fixed the bug about no video stream issue
  + LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MAJOR: is used to control the depreciated APIs
  - BUGGY: the "APIchanges" in FFMPEG has error in av_open_input_file() so
    the version number is not correct about this
    function.

20110824: V1.3.2
  + eznotify.c: fixed a bug that calling the eznotify() with null pointer

20110821: V1.3.1
  + main.c: add '-I' option and move av_log_set_level() to main()
  + ezthumb.c: video_seek_available() fixed a bug that desn't rewind the video
    stream when this function failed.
  - A problem: if the video clip is shorted than it claimed, the output would
    be nasty

20110820: V1.3
  + ezthumb.c: fixed the buggy video_ms_to_pts() and video_system_to_pts()

20110819: merged change from 1.2.2, the '--outdir' option
  + main.c: add command line option "--linear" to indicate the ezthumb
    to walk through the whole video rather than using av_seek_frame()
    Change command line option "--opt-key" to "--anyframe"

20110818: pre V1.3
  + main.c: use a generic event_cb() to handle all notifications.
  + eznotify.c: generic module to handle all notifications.
  + ezthumb.c: isolated the functions to generate thumbnails to:
    video_save_scan_pass(), video_save_quick_pass()
    The problem comes with some .wmv files which could not apply 
    av_seek_frame(). The solution is to walk through the whole video from
    first packet to the last.

20110302:
  + main.c: add command line options to set up colours and font size.

20110301:
  + ezthumb.c: fix the coredump if using still images as input sources.

20110227: V1.2
  + support setting the starting and the ending time position
  + add a status line to the bottom of the canvas

20110223: V1.1
  + support the animated GIF
  + support the transparent background
